    <h2 class="section-title">About the Lab</h2>
    <p>Our research program, funded by an R01 grant, combines molecular biology and engineering to enhance the understanding and treatment of complex congenital heart defects, focusing on hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), improving outcomes for children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and inventing safer surgery management tools. For HLHS, we investigate the role of blood flow in ventricular growth and have identified a stretch-responsive microRNA that may promote ventricular development. In CPB, we aim to mitigate the severe post-surgery inflammatory response in neonatal patients by exploring biomechanical pathways activated during CPB, using mRNA and miRNA sequencing to identify potential drug targets. Our bench-to-bedside approach seeks to provide innovative solutions and improve care for young cardiac patients.</p>

            <h3>Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome</h3>
            <p>Our lab is dedicated to developing innovative methods to mitigate or prevent the inflammatory response that occurs following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in pediatric patients. Pediatric open-heart surgeries often necessitate the use of CPB to provide the surgeon with a clear, bloodless field and to minimize ischemic damage to the body. Unfortunately, CPB patients, particularly neonates, experience significant post-CPB inflammation. This inflammation leads to severe organ dysfunction, notably in the heart and brain, with long-term impacts.

                Given the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with CPB-related organ dysfunction, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular and cellular changes occurring during and after CPB. Our research aims to fill these gaps in scientific knowledge, identifying potential drugs that could effectively limit or eliminate CPB-associated organ dysfunction.
                
                We are investigating how CPB activates biomechanical responsive pathways in circulating blood cells. Despite CPB being performed in the same manner for the past 50 years, the exposure of blood to shear stress, plastic tubing in the CPB circuit, and hypothermia is believed to trigger the inflammatory response. Traditional efforts to curb this inflammation using modified ultrafiltration and corticosteroids have had limited success.
                
                Our lab has conducted mRNA-sequencing and miRNA-sequencing on neonates undergoing CPB to identify key molecular pathways that can be targeted to reduce the post-CPB inflammatory response. Our findings are contributing to discussions about clinical issues in pediatric cardiology that could benefit from bioengineering solutions. Ultimately, our goal is to prevent the inflammatory response during CPB, improving outcomes for pediatric patients.</p>
