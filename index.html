    <h2 class="section-title">About the Lab</h2>
    <p>Our research program, funded by an R01 grant, combines molecular biology and engineering to enhance the understanding and treatment of complex congenital heart defects, focusing on hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), improving outcomes for children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and inventing safer surgery management tools. For HLHS, we investigate the role of blood flow in ventricular growth and have identified a stretch-responsive microRNA that may promote ventricular development. In CPB, we aim to mitigate the severe post-surgery inflammatory response in neonatal patients by exploring biomechanical pathways activated during CPB, using mRNA and miRNA sequencing to identify potential drug targets. Our bench-to-bedside approach seeks to provide innovative solutions and improve care for young cardiac patients.</p>

            <h3>Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome</h3>
            <p>Our lab is dedicated to developing innovative methods to mitigate or prevent the inflammatory response that occurs following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in pediatric patients. Pediatric open-heart surgeries often necessitate the use of CPB to provide the surgeon with a clear, bloodless field and to minimize ischemic damage to the body. Unfortunately, CPB patients, particularly neonates, experience significant post-CPB inflammation. This inflammation leads to severe organ dysfunction, notably in the heart and brain, with long-term impacts.

                Given the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with CPB-related organ dysfunction, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular and cellular changes occurring during and after CPB. Our research aims to fill these gaps in scientific knowledge, identifying potential drugs that could effectively limit or eliminate CPB-associated organ dysfunction.
                
                We are investigating how CPB activates biomechanical responsive pathways in circulating blood cells. Despite CPB being performed in the same manner for the past 50 years, the exposure of blood to shear stress, plastic tubing in the CPB circuit, and hypothermia is believed to trigger the inflammatory response. Traditional efforts to curb this inflammation using modified ultrafiltration and corticosteroids have had limited success.
                
                Our lab has conducted mRNA-sequencing and miRNA-sequencing on neonates undergoing CPB to identify key molecular pathways that can be targeted to reduce the post-CPB inflammatory response. Our findings are contributing to discussions about clinical issues in pediatric cardiology that could benefit from bioengineering solutions. Ultimately, our goal is to prevent the inflammatory response during CPB, improving outcomes for pediatric patients.</p>

            <h3>Cardiopulmonary Bypass Inflammatory Response</h3>
            <p>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is essential for most cardiac surgeries, allowing surgeons to operate under optimal conditions by circulating blood out of the patient’s body. This prevents blood from obstructing the surgical view. However, CPB can induce systemic inflammation, leading to complications such as multiorgan dysfunction. One major challenge in improving treatment methods is the lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying post-CPB inflammation.

                To address this, our lab performed mRNA and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) sequencing on total circulating leukocytes from neonatal patients undergoing CPB. Previous studies identified myeloid cells, particularly monocytes, as key drivers of the transcriptional response to CPB. Our data revealed that inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) are significantly upregulated in leukocytes of CPB patients.
                
                To further investigate these findings, we conducted in-vitro experiments with THP-1 human monocytic cells under CPB-like conditions, including exposure to artificial surfaces, high shear stress, and cooling/rewarming cycles. We collected and analyzed samples at various times post-shear to study how the blood is affected and recovers from CPB. Additionally, we conducted drug treatment experiments using egtazic acid (EGTA) to examine the role of calcium signaling in modulating the post-CPB inflammatory response.
                
                Our observations of chromatin opening and closing in sheared versus static blood samples indicated a strong correlation between IL-8 and potentially IL-2 and patient inflammation. We hypothesize that these specific genomic regions are critical in determining the root cause and potential solutions for post-CPB complications. Further analysis using Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) revealed increased chromatin density and activation in post-CPB samples in the IL-8 and IL-2 regions.
                
                By advancing our understanding of these molecular mechanisms, we hope to develop strategies that reduce complications in patients undergoing CPB, ultimately improving clinical outcomes and patient care.</p>
